# ADR-0001: JSON-Line Structured Logging

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Operational debugging for bots requires machine-readable logs that can be indexed by centralized log backends.

## Decision
Use JSON-line structured logging with fixed envelope keys:
- `ts` UTC timestamp
- `level`
- `msg`
- optional contextual fields

## Consequences
- Better queryability and incident triage
- Slightly higher log verbosity
- Future integration with OpenTelemetry is straightforward
