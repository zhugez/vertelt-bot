# RFC-0001: VerTel Bot Initial Service Blueprint

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The bot requires a maintainable architecture that supports future production hardening (real Telegram API transport, metrics, observability, and HA deployment).

## Decision
Adopt a layered architecture with strict boundaries:
- `core` for deterministic business logic
- `adapters` for external protocols
- `runtime` for cross-cutting runtime behavior
- `platform` for host/environment integration
- `app` as composition root

## Consequences
- Fast iteration with low coupling
- Simplified testing via mockable gateways
- Clear upgrade path to production infrastructure
